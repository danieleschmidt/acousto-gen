# acousto-gen
Generative acoustic holography toolkit for creating 3D pressure fields through ultrasonic transducer arrays. Building on Cambridge's differentiable holography research (2024), this framework enables precise acoustic manipulation for applications in levitation, haptics, and medical ultrasound.
